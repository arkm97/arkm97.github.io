### What is this?
I made this site (mostly) for myself.  I wanted to document all the thinking that went into this project, and compile it in one place.  This site is that documentation.

The "covered calls" strategy is not new---it's a well-known options strategy that comprises selling an option against shares that I already own.  For details, see [Strategy](https://arkm97.github.io/covered-calls/strategy-details/)
