### Strategy Details

#### covered call basics
In breif: this is the sale of a call option while holding the underlying shares referenced in the contract.  The call gives the buyer the right to buy 100 shares at a certain price (the strike price) on or before a certain date (the expiration date).  If the underlying share price is above the strike at expiration, the buyer can exercise the right to buy and make immediate profit.  The buyer pays a premium to enter the contract.  

If the buyer decides to exercise the option, I already hold the requisite 100 shares, and can sell them without having to first buy them at the market price.  

The payoff looks like this:
